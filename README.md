# Data Engineer Path

**Data engineer** builds and manages data workflows, pipelines, ETL processes, and platforms. Data engineers are mainly responsible for management of the entire data lifecycle: ingestion, processing, surfacing, and storage. They leverage their in-depth knowledge of programming, databases, data warehousing, ETL, and data architecture and pipelining, to use complex tools and techniques to handle data at scale. They also deploy machine learning and statistical models in production. This requires data engineers to understand analytics and business intelligence, together with various frameworks and technologies.

For this learning pathway, you will be trained across the following competencies:

- Data Engineering
- Operational Analytics
- Data Governance
- Computing
- Data Visualization
- Data Analytics Methods and Algorithms
- Statistical Techniques
- Research Methods
- Domain Knowledge
