# Getting Grounded on Analytics


## Data Value Chain

- Data, Creating and generation of data from its source; the birth of data
- Information, Consolidation of relevant data to a single repository to answer what happened
- Insights, Finding patterns to answer why it happened and what could likely happen next
- Imperative or Actionable insights, Development various option to suggest what should be done next

### Data Value in Retail (Example)

- purchase is recorded: data and time, location, item bought, any discount, total cost, our data as a customer

  - two: Analytics practitioners are positively engaged by performing tasks that are aligned to their profession and career path


## Decision Support Systems

- Analytics is "a decision support system" because while Analytics can provide the end user with data, information, insights, and prescribed actions, we should maintain that the end user can still choose to act upon them or not
- the final decision is still with the end user
- Analytics is also about the provisioning of data, information, and insights to drive digitalized processes in an intelligent way, e.g., Smart appliances, self-driving cars, manufacturing robots


## Analytics Defined

- Analytics progresses data along its value chain, with the purpose of delivering the right decision support to the right people and digital processes at the right time for the greater good
- note the work that Analytics is expected to perform, and the recipients of its output


## Assessment

This is the primary question answered by Descriptive Analytics.

- [ ] What data do we have?
- [x] What happened?
- [ ] What could likely happen next?
- [ ] What should be done next?

This answers the question, "What data do we have?"

- [x] Data Governance
- [ ] Descriptive Analytics
- [ ] Predictive Analytics
- [ ] Prescriptive Analytics

This is where data is collected, cleaned, transformed, aggregated, and consolidated to a single repository.

- [ ] Data
- [x] Information
- [ ] Insights
- [ ] Imperatives

This is where trends and patterns from recent and historical data are found.

- [ ] Data
- [ ] Information
- [x] Insights
- [ ] Imperatives

This is the primary question answered by Diagnostic Analytics.

- [ ] What data do we have?
- [ ] What happened?
- [x] Why did it happen?
- [ ] What should be done next?

They design, construct, test, and maintain data infrastructures including applications that extract, clean, transform, and load data from data sources to centralized data repositories.

- [x] Data Engineer

## Summary (Key Take-Away Points)

- Analytics mines and refines data to extract its value
as it transforms data to information, to insights, and
to imperatives
- This transformation is performed through the
various Analytics roles: data steward, data engineer,
data scientist, functional analyst, and analytics manager.
  - It is important that the right people are assigned to the right roles.
- Analytics is still just a decision support system that
enables us, the end user, to make the final ethical
