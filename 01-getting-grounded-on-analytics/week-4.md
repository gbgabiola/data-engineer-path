## What is strategy?

- strategy:
  - is a description of the overall way in which an organization currently is, and is to be run
  - covers a year at a time
  - aligns the organization's business area, resources, and activities to the market in which the organization operates
  - attempts to handle issues in the short run while, at the same time, trying to create competitive advantages in the long run
- alignment is the highlight
  - anything that anyone does in an organization should be
aligned to the **overall mission and vision** of the
organization
- if a project/initiative is not aligned with the organization's strategy
  - no point in doing that project in the first place
- Philippine organizations doesn't embrace Analytics
  - because the leadership team is not seeing the value of Analytics
projects being initiated within a unit/department (IT)
- Analytics projects are usually started within a unit without aligning the intended output to the organization's overall objectives
  - thus, when presented to the leadership team, the potential value is lost


## Building an Analytics Strategy Road Map

### Act 1: A Company's Vision and Goals

- Analytic roles:
  - Data Steward
  - Data Engineer
  - Data Scientist
  - Functional Analyst
  - Analytics Manager
- roles that supports Analytics team:
  - Leadership
  - Department Head
  - IT Engineer
- companies objective: increase their market share from 15%
to 20%
- Department Head of the Marketing Department, said, "In order for us to increase our market share, we need to attract new customers."
  - asked ideas from the team who are marketing experts:
    - increase marketing campaigns
    - go to social media
    - get celebrities for endorsements
  - agreed in principle, but wanted to be more focused and more targeted
- Functional Analyst suggested, "How about looking into past sales records and see who are our loyal customers? Perhaps we can deduce who to target based on this information."
  - experties in marketing and in retail
  - has hunch that: gender, generation, location, and income level could affect a customer's decision to buy.
- Data Scientist is excited that she can do something that is aligned to their organization's agenda
  - hunch is actually a hypothesis
  - that's how Analytics projects are started: with a hunch that needs to be proven by data

### Act 2: A Proof of Concept

- as part of the research method, they need more data points to test their hypothesis
  - need access to data
- Data Steward is the data keeper, asked what data they would need and why
  - scrutinized their request and questioned the need for sensitive, personally-identifiable information, that is, data that could point to a single known person
  - based on her evaluation, she determined that such information as name, TIN, and actual birth month and date will not matter in the project
- Data Scientist is expert in statistics, Analytics methods and algorithms,trained and tested her model
  - to determine whether gender, generation, location, and income level do affect a customer's decision to buy
    - if they do affect decision making, to what degree do they affect that decision
  - after several iterations, able to come up with a formula to score a potential customer's decision to buy
  - in formula: determined that gender, generation, and income level contributed equally to the decision-making process of customers, but that location doesn't matter at all
