## The AAP Professional Maturity Model

- roles requiring business and industry knowledge, i.e., **Data Stewards** and **Functional Analysts**, would require higher proficiency in the business and organizational skills
- roles requiring technical competencies, i.e., **Data Engineers** and **Data Scientists**, would require higher proficiency in the technical skills
- **Analytics Managers** should have high proficiency in business and industry skills as well as entry-level proficiency in the technical skills to effectively manage Analytics projects
- all roles are expected to have high proficiency in the 21st century skills

### AAP Professional Maturity Model Notes

- First: The 3-level toolkit is but a subset of a larger pool of proficiency expectations per level, per competency
- Second: The model can be used not only by Analytics professionals to chart their career paths.
  - it can also be used by other stakeholders to build their own solutions for _educating_, _training_, _certifying_, _recruiting_, _managing_, and otherwise supporting Analytics and Analytics-enabled professionals
- Lastly: the Analytics Association of the Philippines invites everyone, from the private sector, to the academe, to government agencies to further develop and enhance the AAP Professional Maturity Model through the adoption and the evaluation of this framework
