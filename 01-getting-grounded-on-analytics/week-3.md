## The DELTA+ Model

The DELTA+ Model has seven elements that must evolve and mature for organizations to succeed in their Analytics initiatives.

seven elements are:

1. **D**: Integrated, high-quality, and easily accessible **DATA** 
2. **E**: Managing Analytics resources in a coordinated fashion across the **ENTERPRISE**
3. **L**: Strong, committed **LEADERSHIP** that understands the importance of analytics and constantly advocates their use in decision and actions
4. **T**: Selecting the right, strategic, organizational **TARGETS** that will be the core of an Analytics roadmap
5. **A**: Nurturing high-performing **ANALYTICS PROFESSIONAL** 
6. **T**: **TECHNOLOGIES** that will support Analytics across the organization
7. **A**: Various **ANALYTICAL TECHNIQUES** ranging from simple descriptive statistics to machine learning


### D for Data

Organizations must ensure that high quality data is organized and accessible by the right people.

- **Level 1**: Inconsistent, poor-quality, and unstandardized data; difficult to do substantial analysis; no groups with strong data orientation
- **Level 2**: Standardize and structured data, mostly in functional or process silos; senior executives do not discuss data management
- **Level 3**: Key data domains identified, and central data repositories created
- **Level 4**: Integrated, accurate, common data in central repositories; data still mainly an IT matter, little unique data
- **Level 5**: Relentless search for new data and metrics leveraging structured and unstructured data (e.g., text, video); data viewed as a strategic asset

### E for Enterprise

Analytical organizations advocate a single and consistent
perspective for Analytics across the enterprise.

This is accomplished by setting an Analytics strategy
and building a roadmap to implement that strategy.

- **Level 1**: No enterprise perspective on data or analytics; poorly integrated systems
- **Level 2**: Islands of data, technology, and expertise deliver local value
- **Level 3**: Process or business unit focus for analytics; infrastructure for analytics beginning to coalesce
- **Level 4**: Key data, technology, and analytics professionals managed from an enterprise perspective
- **Level 5**: Key analytical resources focused on enterprise priorities and differentiation


### L for Leadership

Analytical organizations have leaders who fully embrace Analytics and lead company culture towards data-driven decision-making.

Beyond the C-level, all levels of leadership within the enterprise should support Analytics.

- **Level 1**: Little awareness of or interest in analytics
- **Level 2**: Local leaders emerge but have little connection
- **Level 3**: Senior leaders recognize importance of analytics and developing analytical capabilities
- **Level 4**: Senior leaders develop analytical plans and build analytical capabilities
- **Level 5**: Strong leaders behave analytically and show passion for analytical competition

### T for Targets

Analytics efforts must be aligned with specific, strategic targets that are also aligned with the objectives of the organization.

At the highest maturity level, these targets become embedded in the strategic planning process and are considered business initiatives and not just Analytics initiatives.

- **Level 1**: No targeting of opportunities
- **Level 2**: Multiple disconnected targets, typically not of strategic importance
- **Level 3**: Analytical efforts coalesce behind a small set of important targets
- **Level 4**: Analytics is centered on a few key business domains with explicit and ambitious outcomes
- **Level 5**: Analytics is integral to the company's distinctive
capability and strategy

### A for Analytics Professionals

Organizations require analytical talent that covers a range of skills and roles, once the right people are in place, keeping them motivated with creative and challenging projects is crucial.

- **Level 1**: Few skills that are attached to specific functions
- **Level 2**: Unconnected pockets of analytics professionals; unmanaged mix of skills
- **Level 3**: Analytics professionals recognized as key talent and focused on important business areas
- **Level 4**: Highly capable analytics professionals explicitly recruited, developed, deployed, and engaged
- **Level 5**: World-class professional analytics professionals;
cultivation of analytical amateurs across the enterprise

### T for Technology

As the technology for Analytics rapidly evolves, an organization's ability to deploy and manage the underlying infrastructure, tools, and technologies become increasingly important.

- **Level 1**: Desktop technology, standard office packages, poorly integrated systems
- **Level 2**: Individual analytical initiatives, statistical packages, descriptive analytics, database querying, tabulations
- **Level 3**: Enterprise analytical plan, tool and platforms; predictive analytical packages
- **Level 4**: Enterprise analytical plan and processes, cloud- based big data
- **Level 5**: Sophisticated, enterprise-wide big data and analytics infrastructure, cognitive technologies, prescriptive analytics

### A for Analytical Techniques

With rapidly evolving technology comes a higher level of sophistication from the various analytical techniques that organizations may use in their decision-making process, ranging from simple descriptive statistics to
machine learning.

- **Level 1**: Mostly ad-hoc, simple math, extrapolation, trending
- **Level 2**: Basic statistics, segmentation, database querying, tabulations of key metrics are leveraged to gain insights
- **Level 3**: Simple predictive analytics, classification and clustering, dynamic forecasts
- **Level 4**: Advanced predictive methods deployed to discover insights, advanced optimization, sentiment analytics, text and image analytics
- **Level 5**: Neural nets and deep learning, genetic algorithms, advanced machine learning


## The Stages of Analytical Maturity

- **Level 1, Analytically Impaired**: The organization lacks one or several of the prerequisites for serious analytical work, such as data, analytical skills, or senior management interest
- **Level 2, Localized Analytics**: There are pockets of analytical activity within the organization, but they are not coordinated or focused on strategic targets
- **Level 3, Analytical Aspirations**: The organization envisions a more analytical future, has established analytical capabilities, and has a few significant initiatives under way, but progress is slowâ€”often because some critical factors have been too difficult to implement
- **Level 4, Analytical Organization**: The organization has the needed human and technological resources, applies analytics regularly, and realizes benefits across the business
  - But its strategic focus is not grounded in analytics, and it hasn't turned analytics to competitive advantage
- **Level 5, Analytical Competitor**: The organization routinely uses analytics as a distinctive business capability
  - It takes an enterprise-wide approach, has committed and involved leadership, and has achieved large-scale results
